# Compendium migration record

The working record for moving the notes written before the study method into the guide's typed entries. The plan, with its type mapping and order, is in [compendium/README.md](../compendium/README.md); this file records what has been done, what was checked and the map of legacy files to pathways. Check the map and progress with `python3 tools/migration_status.py` (add `--check` to fail on any problem).

## Four kinds of progress, kept apart

| Kind | What it means | Where it is recorded | Set by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Migration progress | A legacy block has a disposition: rewritten as an entry, merged into one, stubbed in a backlog, or deleted | This file and `tools/migration_status.py` | The migration |
| Source verification | An entry's claims have been compared with the passages at their locators | Each entry's *Status: Verification*, and the checks table below | Whoever reads the passage |
| Learner mastery | A pathway's checkpoint passed from your own notes, readings closed | `notes/log.md`, *Mastered* | You only |
| Pathway consolidation | Everything the pathway relies on is in checked entries and its backlog is empty | `notes/log.md`, *Consolidated* | You, after review |

Migrating a block and compiling the result advances only the first. An entry written during migration starts as a draft whose verification says exactly what was compared; no migration step sets a mastery or consolidation date.

## Conventions

- **Legacy staging.** Old chapters live in `compendium/legacy/<section-key>/` and compile, through `compendium/legacy/part.tex`, as the final part *Notes awaiting migration*. This is a temporary convention of this repository, not part of the guide's layout. Their chapter labels carry a `legacy:` prefix so that they never collide with the canonical chapter label (`\label{<section-key>}`) when that chapter appears. Their block, figure and remark labels are unchanged.
- **Canonical homes.** Migrated entries go in `compendium/<section-key>/`, in the section where the guide first needs the concept. Other pathways link to that entry rather than restating it.
- **Map.** `% migrate-to: key, key` on the first line of each legacy file with blocks names the pathways its blocks are *candidate* material for. These lists are provisional: drawn from the plan's folder table and narrowed by file name, not from reading every block. A file listing several pathways is shared material; none of those pathways owns its blocks until one is assigned.
- **Assignment.** `% assign: <pathway-key>` on the line before a block assigns that block to one pathway. Only assigned blocks, or blocks in a file with a single candidate, count towards one pathway; the status script lists shared, unassigned blocks separately.
- **Removal.** A block is deleted from a legacy file only when its content is represented in an entry, a backlog stub or an artefact, and the pathways that list the file can find it: the deletion site keeps a `% migrated:` comment naming the destination labels.
- **Derivations.** When an entry keeps only the idea of a proof, the full working goes to `notes/artefacts/<pathway-key>/`, and the entry's *Further reading* names the file.

## Baseline: 14 October 2026, before Phase 0 (commit `9634e2b`)

- **Blocks:** 879 in the old environments, of which 12 were in the tooling appendix and 867 in the finance chapters: `taxonomy` 178, `remark` 146, `caveat` 113, `definition` 98, `mechanism` 81, `principle` 80, `model` 58, `method` 31, `proposition` 25, `process` 18, `marketrule` 18, `practitionernote` 14, `empiricalfinding` 11, `casestudy` 3, `notation` 2, `corollary` 2, `lemma` 1.
- **Labels:** five figure labels and one remark label (`rmk:propfracdifffeat`); no entry labels.
- **Figures:** the 21 PNG files in `execution-trading-costs/figures/` were referenced by no file.
- **Build** (`latexmk -g -pdf compendium.tex`, TeX Live, pdfTeX): exit 0; 143 pages; no LaTeX warnings, no undefined references or citations; 0 overfull and 30 underfull boxes; 7 pdfTeX warnings for duplicate destinations (`page.i` and six `figure.*` anchors).

## Phase 0: done 14 October 2026

1. Moved the seven chapters unchanged (`git mv`) to `compendium/legacy/<section-key>/`, rewrote their `\input` and figure paths, renamed their chapter labels to `legacy:<section-key>` and the one cross-chapter reference, and compiled them as *Notes awaiting migration*. The 21 unused execution figures moved with `legacy/execution-trading-costs/figures/`.
2. Moved the tooling appendix (calculator, reading AI papers, Python, VS Code), with its figures and its three sources (`downey-2015`, `ramalho-2015`, `speight-2021`), to `notes/tooling/`, which compiles on its own (`latexmk -pdf tooling.tex`). The VS Code and Python files stay commented out of it, as they were; they also compile when enabled.
3. Replaced the placeholder preface (*Lorem Ipsum* overview and roadmap) with a short description of the layout, keeping its acknowledgement of Narang, Velu and López de Prado.
4. Moved `hyperref` to the end of `compendium/preamble.tex`: loaded before `float` and `algorithm`, it gave every captioned figure a duplicate anchor. `house.tex` and the guide submodule are unchanged.
5. Added this file, the `% migrate-to:` lines in 71 legacy files, and `tools/migration_status.py` with its tests (`python3 -m unittest discover -s tools`).
6. Declared the pilot's notation overrides in `compendium/front/notation.tex`.

## Pilot: `market-making-lob` format pilot, 14 October 2026

A test of the entry format on the formal models named in the plan, not a migration of the pathway. Grossman–Miller and Kyle are supplemental to `market-making-lob`; its required readings (Glosten–Milgrom, Ho–Stoll, Guéant–Lehalle–Fernandez-Tapia, the queue and order-flow papers) are not covered, and the pathway is neither mastered nor consolidated.

### Source findings

- The legacy Grossman–Miller block, with its fee extension and liquidity measures, and the *Market Making using Limit Orders* block follow Cartea, Jaimungal and Penalva, *Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading* (`crypto-cartea`), chapter "A Primer on the Microstructure of Financial Markets", pp. 20–30, in notation and order. They cited `grossman-miller-1988` and `ho-stoll-1981`, neither of which was consulted.
- The limit-order block is **not** the Ho–Stoll model. The book sets it up as a static simplification in place of Ho and Stoll (1981), which it calls the usual first reference (p. 28). Its citation of `ho-stoll-1981` was therefore wrong for its formulas; the entry cites `crypto-cartea` and lists `ho-stoll-1981` only as further reading. `catalogue-0527`, the route's Ho–Stoll reading, is a topic lead that names no paper and was not substituted for one.
- The legacy Kyle equilibrium ($\beta=\sigma_u/\sigma_v$, $\lambda=\sigma_v/(2\sigma_u)$, profit $\sigma_v\sigma_u/2$, posterior variance $\sigma_v^2/2$) agrees with O'Hara, *Market Microstructure Theory* (`catalogue-0496`), chapter "Strategic Trader Models I: Informed Traders", pp. 91–98, eqs. (4.3)–(4.5), (4.17), (4.20). `crypto-cartea` p. 33 prints $\lambda=2\sigma_u/\sigma$, the reciprocal, which contradicts its own step $\beta=(2\lambda)^{-1}$; the entry records the conflict in its *Pitfalls*. The legacy block cited `s6-kyle`, which was not consulted.
- The legacy Avellaneda–Stoikov formulas agree with the author-hosted journal PDF of `s6-stoikov` (eqs. (8), (12), (29)–(30)), with one omission now stated: the spread formula is an approximation from an expansion in inventory with a linearised order-arrival term (sec. 3.2), not the exact solution.

### Checks and their limits

| Source | Copy used | Passages compared | Limits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `crypto-cartea` | Local scan, 2015 Cambridge printing, no text layer | pp. 20–33: every formula and statement the entries cite, read from page images, with OCR for the running text | Some signs on p. 26 are faint in the scan; the printed results agree with the clearing condition on the same page |
| `catalogue-0496` | Local scan, 1998 Wiley printing of the 1995 book | pp. 91–98, eqs. (4.1), (4.3)–(4.5), (4.16)–(4.17), (4.20), from page images and OCR | A later printing than the catalogue's 1995 record; page numbers may differ in other printings |
| `s6-stoikov` | Author-hosted journal PDF, the copy named in the catalogue's version record | pp. 217–222, eqs. (1)–(30), Table 1, text layer | The HJB and expansion steps were read, not re-derived |
| `grossman-miller-1988`, `ho-stoll-1981`, `s6-kyle` | Not available locally | None | Cited only as further reading, marked not yet read |

Every pilot entry is therefore *partly checked*, *draft* and, except Avellaneda–Stoikov, *timeless*. **Human review is outstanding** for all six entries: their wording, the interpretations they flag, and the locators, before any is marked *checked*.

### Dispositions of the pilot blocks

| Legacy block (file, before migration) | Disposition |
|---|---|
| *Grossman-Miller Model* (`05_.../01_economics_of_market_making.tex`), main equilibrium | Rewritten as `mod:grossman-miller`; figure kept as `fig:grossman_miller_trading` |
| same block, *Trading Costs* part | Rewritten as `res:grossman-miller-trading-fees` |
| same block, *Measuring Liquidity* part | Rewritten as `res:grossman-miller-liquidity-measures` |
| same block, *Implications* items on free entry ("until spread capture just covers $c$") and market design (migration to search, block crossing or delayed execution) | Not supported by `crypto-cartea`; kept verbatim in the artefact and stubbed in the pathway backlog as needing `grossman-miller-1988` |
| *Kyle Model* (same file) | Rewritten as `mod:kyle-single-auction` |
| *Kyle Linear Price Impact* and *Kyle Linear Equilibrium* (`03_.../05_information_based_models.tex`), a second version of the same model in other notation | Merged into `mod:kyle-single-auction` (same equilibrium; its notation, $p_\infty$, $n_\omega$, $\tilde P$, is kept in the artefact) |
| *Market Making using Limit Orders* (same file as Grossman–Miller) | Rewritten as `mod:static-limit-order-depth`; figure kept as `fig:limit_order_market_making` |
| *Avellaneda-Stoikov Setup*, *Reservation Price*, *Symmetric Optimal Spread* (`05_.../02_avellaneda_stoikov_framework.tex`) | Merged into `mod:avellaneda-stoikov` |
| *Framework, Not Production Model* caveat (same file) | Merged into the *Pitfalls* of `mod:avellaneda-stoikov`, marked as interpretation |
| *Quote-Control Segmentation* taxonomy (same file) | Left in legacy, assigned to `market-making-lob`: a list without a claim to check, to be placed in a quoting entry at consolidation |
| *Inventory-Skew Quoting* model (`03_.../04_inventory_models.tex`) | Left in legacy, assigned to `market-making-lob`: Ho–Stoll-related, unsourced, needs the Ho–Stoll paper |
| *Adverse Selection Through Flow* principle (`03_.../05_information_based_models.tex`) | Left in legacy, shared: interpretation of the Kyle and Glosten–Milgrom mechanisms, to be placed when Glosten–Milgrom is migrated |

All removed blocks are kept verbatim, with only figure paths changed, in `notes/artefacts/market-making-lob/derivations.tex`, which compiles on its own. Each deletion site in the legacy files carries a `% migrated:` comment naming its destination.

### Source blockers

| Needed | Why | Passage required |
|---|---|---|
| Ho and Stoll (1981), *Journal of Financial Economics* 9(1) (`ho-stoll-1981`); the route reads it through `catalogue-0527`, which names no paper | `market-making-lob` requires a Ho–Stoll inventory entry; the legacy *Inventory-Skew Quoting* block cannot be sourced without it | The section deriving the dealer's optimal bid and ask as functions of inventory, with the equation numbers |
| Grossman and Miller (1988), *Journal of Finance* 43(3) (`grossman-miller-1988`) | Two legacy implications are not in `crypto-cartea` | The participation-cost (entry) stage and the discussion of market structure for large orders |
| Kyle (1985), *Econometrica* 53(6) (`s6-kyle`) | To check the single-auction results at the original, and the misprint in `crypto-cartea` p. 33 | The single-auction equilibrium theorem and its proof |

### Build after the pilot

`latexmk -g -pdf compendium.tex`: exit 0; 139 pages (the tooling appendix left; six entries came in); no LaTeX warnings, no undefined references or citations; 0 overfull and 26 underfull boxes; one pdfTeX duplicate-destination warning, `page.i`, inherited from `\maketitle` before the roman-numbered front matter. Rendered and inspected: the contents, notation and preface; the new chapter (pp. 1–5; pp. 2 and 4 at full size, with both figures); the part title page (p. 6); and the pruned legacy market-making section (p. 116).

## Next bounded slice

Glosten–Milgrom and the rest of the `market-making-lob` candidate material in `legacy/execution-market-making/05_market_making_and_liquidity_provision/` and `03_.../05_information_based_models.tex`: assign or dispose of each block, write the Glosten–Milgrom entry from `s6-glosten` (the route's first reading) and `crypto-cartea` pp. 34–37, and fold in the Ho–Stoll entry if the paper has been obtained. Run it as part of the study loop for `market-making-lob`, not as consolidation.

## File map

One row per legacy file with blocks; `tools/migration_status.py --check` fails if this table and the files' `% migrate-to:` lines disagree.
