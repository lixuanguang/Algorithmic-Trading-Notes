\subsection{Transaction Costs}

\subsubsection{Transaction Cost Taxonomy}
% Classification of trading costs
% - Explicit costs: commissions, fees, taxes
% - Implicit costs: spread, impact, timing, opportunity
% - Total cost of ownership
% Sources: Harris Ch.20; Johnson Ch.10

\begin{remark} \hlt{Spread Types for Cost Measurement}\\
Cost differences for effective and realised spreads to be doubled, as both are calculated using the mid price.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Quoted spread: Market quality measure (best bid $-$ offer price)
\item Effective spread: Execution cost (trade price $-$ quote midpoint when order was received)
\item Realised spread: Trading intermediary profits (trade price $-$ quote midpoint 5 minutes after the trade)
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Benchmark Types for Cost Measurement}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Post-Trade: closing prices. Used as milestone for mark to market, and P\&L computations
\item Intraday: Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC), Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP), Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP). Accurately reflect intraday market conditions.
\item Pre-Trade: previous close, open price, decision price, arrival price. Measure of performance on average price achieved in execution, and market price when investor decision was first made.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Components of Transaction Costs}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Explicit: commissions, fees, and taxes, quoted in basis points.
\item Implicit: timing cost, delay cost, impact, opportunity cost.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Implementation Shortfall}
% Perold's framework for measuring execution quality
% - Paper portfolio vs. actual portfolio
% - Components: delay, trading, opportunity
% - IS as a benchmark
% - Realized vs. expected IS

\subsubsection{Trading Benchmarks}
% Reference prices for execution quality
% - Arrival price (decision price)
% - VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
% - TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price)
% - Close price
% - Interval VWAP
% - Benchmark selection considerations

\subsubsection{Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA)}
% Post-trade analysis framework
% - Pre-trade estimation
% - Real-time monitoring
% - Post-trade evaluation
% - Attribution analysis
% - Peer comparison
% Sources: Johnson Ch.11; Lehalle Ch.7

\subsubsection{Cost Models}
% Predictive models for transaction costs
% - I-Star and other market impact models
% - Regression-based approaches
% - Machine learning for cost prediction
% - Model validation and backtesting
