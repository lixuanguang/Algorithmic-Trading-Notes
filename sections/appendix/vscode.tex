\subsection{Visual Studio Code}

Based on the book by April \cite{speight_2020}.

\end{figure}

Activity bar on the far-left side allows switching between views, with quick access to tasks such as:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Explorer: file and folder management
\item Search: global search and replace, can use plain text or regex
\item Source Control: Git source control
\item Run: for debugging, such as variables, call stacks, breakpoints
\item Extensions: browsing, installation, management of extensions
\end{enumerate}
Activity bar may also provide custom views from extensions installed from Extension Marketplace. Views may be hidden, dragged and dropped around.\\

Side bar displays active view. Editor where files may be edited, may be resized, and top editor region changes depending on the type of file active in the editor; the top bar may also have a Source Control view if project is connected to git; files may be pinned and grouped by tabs.

\end{figure}

Panels are for debugging information, errors and warnings; and also for opening an integrated terminal on the root of the project. A REPL terminal (Python standard shell) may also be opened.\\

The status bar contains information about the opened project and files being edited. This includes: source control management with Git, total number of problems for the opened programs, line/column, indentation settings for space or tabs, encoding setting, end-of-line sequence setting, language mode, VS Code feedback mechanism, and notifications.\\

The command palette at the very top of the UI can be used to run commands to execute editor tasks in addition to extension commands.\\

\subsubsection{Setting Up Python}

To set default interpreter path in VS Code, in settings editor, search for \hlt{python.pythonPath}. In Python: Default Interpreter Path setting, enter the path to the interpreter.\\

To enable Quick Fix which help fix issues identified by warnings or errors (with lightbulb popping up), in settings editor, search for \hlt{python.jediEnabled}, then set it to false.\\

IntelliSense is a variety of tools to assist wth programming, such as code completion, object definition, location of object or variable declarations. These are triggered by either pressing Ctrl+Spacebar, or by tying a trigger character (i.e., a dot character in Python).\\

If linter detects any errors, these will be present in the Panels' Problem tab.\\

Refactoring is used to maintain functionality while improving the internal structure or architecture of a program. This should be a routine task that occurs before any updates or new features are added to a program. VS Code can help with refactoring via the following commands in Command Palette: Extract Variable, Extract Method, Sort Imports. Refactoring requires the \hlt{Rope} library.\\
Extract variable command allows extracting all similar occurrences of the same constant value of expression in multiple places, and replaces it with a variable. May be accessed via Python Refactor: Extract Variable.\\
Extract method command extracts all similar occurrences of selected expression or block, creates a new method, and replaces the expression with a method call. May be accessed via Python Refactor: Extract Method.\\
Sort imports method uses \hlt{isort} packages to consolidate specific imports from the same module into a single import statement, and organises 'import' statements in alphabetical order.\\

If a code pattern is repeated within a file or across multiple files, code snippets may be used, by searching in Command Palette for Snippets: Configure User Snippets. 

\subsubsection{Debugging}

After starting debug session, the Run view opens. As the debugger runs, the current state of variables is reflected in Variables panel, which organises variables into local and global scopes. In the editor, the Debug toolbar will appear with the following functionalities:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Continue (A): Runs all the code after the breakpoint up to the next breakpoint or end of program.
\item Step Over (B): Step line by line at the current scope. If current line is a function call, debugger runs the function entirely and then pauses at the next line after function call.
\item Step Into (C): Steps over each line within the function scope and any additional function calls.
\item Step Out (D): To exit from within a function to the scope that called it.
\item Restart (E); Stops execution and restarts the debugging session.
\item Stop (F): Stop all execution without finishing the program.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

The side bar also has a call stack section, which shows the whole chain of function calls leading up to the current point of execution. Useful if calls go through other files in the project.\\

Conditional breakpoint allows for stopping of the code during specific conditions to evaluate and debug.

A logpoint outputs message to Debug Console without breaking the debugger. Expressions can be evaluated within curly braces.

\end{figure}

If program has a lot of variables which is hard to keep track of in variables pane, the variables may be added to the Watch panel which keep tracks of the variables.\\

The Debug Console allows access and modification of all the program's variables, call functions, evaluate expressions, and whatever code in the program's current state, rather than modifying the code and restarting. Different scenarios may be tested in the Debug Console and copy the fix into the program while the debugger is paused. The Debug Console also shows suggestions as code is typed.\\

To enable a test framework, \hlt{pytest} or \hlt{unittest} must be installed. Run the command Python: Configure Test to select the framework, directory that contains the test, and pattern to identify test files.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item unittest: Looks for any Python file with 'test' in the name in top-level project folder. All test files must be importable modules or packages. To specify discovery pattern, change the pattern in \hlt{python.testing.unitTestArgs}.
\item pytest: Looks for any Python file beginning with 'test\_' or ends with '\_test' located anywhere within current folder and all subfolders.
\end{enumerate}
