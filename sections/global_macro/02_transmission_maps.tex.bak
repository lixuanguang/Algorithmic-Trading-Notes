\subsection{Transmission and Cross-Asset Mapping}

\subsubsection{Building Blocks of Global Macro}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Macro Strategy Product Groups}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Fixed Income (Policy and Growth Sensor): encodes growth expectations, inflation expectations, central bank credibility. Yield curves summarise the entire macro narrative; Steepening means growth/reflation; Flattening or inversion means slowdown/recession.\\
Fixed income tells what the market thinks will happen before it happens
\item Foreign Exchange (Adjustment Mechanism): FX reflects relative, not absolute, macro conditions. Sensitive to rate differentials, capital flows, balance of payments, risk-on/risk-off regimes.\\
FX absorbs and redistributes macro shocks across countries.
\item Equities (Growth Expression): equities are long growth, long liquidity, short uncertainty. Equity indices aggregate earnings expectations, discount rates, risk appetite.\\
Volatility (VIX) is a second-order macro signal, not just an equity signal.\\
Equities express the confidence (or fear) embedded in the macro outlook.
\item Commodities (Inflation and Real-Economy Link): driven by physical supply and demand, inventories, geopolitics. Highly sensitive to growth cycles, inflation shocks, currency moves (especially USD).\\
Commodities anchor macro views in real economic constraints.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Relationship Between Assets}\\
These relationships are regime-dependent, not permanent laws.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Growth Shocks: rates rise, equities rally, cyclicals outperform, commodities rise. FX favours growth-linked currencies (AUD, CAD, EM FX etc.).
\item Recession Shocks: rates fall, curves flatten/invert, equities sell off, USD strengthens, commodities weaken (except gold)
\item Inflation Shocks: nominal rates up, real rates determine equity impact. Commodities outperform. FX punishes low-credibility central banks
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Asset Correlation Relationships}\\
Asset correlations change under stress. Diversification fails when you need it most. Assets that appear uncorrelated in calm periods may collapse together in crises.\\
Macro traders profit when they anticipate correlation breakdowns, and position for nonlinear regime shifts.\\
This is why macro portfolios use convex instruments, size conservatively, focus on liquidity.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Macro View Thesis}\\
A macro view expressed in only one asset class is incomplete.\\
A single macro thesis should have multiple expressions, each with different risk profiles, for example
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Growth view: rates, equities, FX
\item Inflation view: commodities, breakevens, FX
\item Crisis view: bonds, USD, volatility
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Foreign Exchange in Global Macro}

FX plays three special roles simultaneously:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Macro shock absorber 
\item Macro transmission channel 
\item Macro expression instrument
\end{enumerate}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Role of the US Dollar}\\
Global macro is de facto USD-centric, as USD is the global reserve currency, most commodities are USD-priced, global funding markets clear in USD, and cross-border leverage is USD-denominated.\\
Many “local” macro trades are actually USD liquidity trades in disguise.\\
Stress often appears first in US Dollar Index (DXY), cross-currency basis, EM FX before local assets.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Currency Regimes}\\
Currency regimes matter more than models. FX does not behave uniformly. Regime dominates signal.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Free-floating regimes: price discovery happens in FX
\item Managed/pegged regimes: pressure builds elsewhere (rates, reserves, capital controls)
\item Hard pegs: FX looks stable until it breaks violently
\end{enumerate}
FX valuation only works within regime constraints. Ignore the regime and “cheap” can stay cheap forever.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Valuation Techniques}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Market Implied and Risk-Appetite Signals
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Equity Index Price Performance: strong local equities (vs peers) attract inflows and support currency; sharp equity underperformance foreshadow FX weakness via risk-off deleveraging and foreign selling.
\item Credit/Sovereign Risk: widening sovereign spreads/CDS is a direct “default/policy credibility/funding stress” signal weaken FX or raise devaluation risk premia). Also a regime detector for EM FX.
\item Sentiment/Positioning: call-put skew on three-month risk reversals. Acts as a multiplier. Can create overshoots/undershoots around fair value in crowded carry or crisis episodes.
\end{enumerate}
\item Trade and Competitiveness Fundamentals
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Trade Balance/External Account: structurally strong trade position often supports FX; persistent deficits can make the currency reliant on financing
\item Trade-Weighted Index (TWI): reflects currency’s effective competitiveness against trading partners currency basket that matters for the real economy.
\item Economic Activity: strong activity can support FX via higher expected returns and inflows, but it can also worsen the trade balance
\item Export Partner Growth and Direct Exports: mapping who buys exports and whether those buyers are expanding/contracting. Export partner growth leads exporter’s FX through expected trade receipts.
\end{enumerate}
\item Macro Sustainability/Macro Indicators: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Debt-to-GDP: high public debt with FX liabilities or weak domestic savings can increase risk premia and currency vulnerability, as it tightens the policy constraint set (inflation vs austerity vs default).
\end{enumerate}
\item Long-Term Valuation Anchors
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Absolute and Relative PPP: can take up to several years for consumer prices to converge.
\item GDP Per Capita: structural development/productivity proxy. Richer, higher productivity economies tend to sustain stronger real exchange rates over time.
\end{enumerate}
\item Carry Indicators
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item OIS Differential: compares respective policy rates of two countries. If exchange rate is fixed, to hold higher-yielding currency. Carry is interest rate differential between two or a basket of currencies.
\item LIBOR Differential: LIBOR is an unsecured borrowing rate that banks charge each other. LIBOR can be decomposed as $\text{LIBOR} = \text{Fed Funds} + (\text{LIBOR} - \text{Fed Funds})$, where Fed Funds is the risk-free component and $(\text{LIBOR} - \text{Fed Funds})$ is the credit (risk) component. Using relative spreads gives a sense of direction; interest rate differential drives demand for a currency.
\item Risk-Adjusted Carry: adjusts carry for volatility. Outperforms standard carry trades and is useful in cross-currency analysis. The carry-to-risk ratio is calculated as
\begin{equation*}
\text{Carry-to-Risk Ratio} = \frac{\text{3M Carry (LIBOR Differential)}}{\text{30D Realized Volatility}}
\end{equation*}
Within high-yielding currency pairs, one would ideally want the highest carry-to-risk ratio. Volatility and carry components are always in flux, so adjustments should be made frequently.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Carry Trade Mechanics}\\
Carry strategies are typically executed by borrowing in lower-yielding currencies (JPY, USD, EUR) and buying higher-yielding currencies (AUD, NZD, BRL, TRY, ZAR, and other EM currencies).\\
The carry trade is a crowded trade, meaning in large risk-off markets (such as 2008), the strategy suffers significant losses as positions unwind simultaneously.\\
Carry is the return one makes on holding a currency, assuming the exchange rate is held constant. In practice, exchange rate moves often dominate carry returns.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Carry Trade Risk Factors}\\
Key risks to carry trades include:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Crowding Risk: carry trades are popular, leading to violent unwinds during risk-off episodes.
\item Gap Risk: EM currencies can gap significantly on weekends or during crises, bypassing stop-losses.
\item Regime Shifts: central bank policy changes can rapidly alter rate differentials.
\item Correlation Breakdown: in stress, all carry currencies tend to sell off together against funding currencies.
\end{enumerate}
Finding the carry-to-risk ratio is useful, as is comparing all currency pairs on a relative basis. Measuring the standard error of the sample and finding the most attractive pairs helps in mean-reverting carry strategies.
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Equities in Global Macro}

In macro, a trader should understand equity in terms of market behaviour in the country being traded, the sectors that make up those indices, and correlation risk.

\begin{remark} \hlt{Top-Down Macro Approach to Equities}\\
Many macro traders take a top-down approach to trading equities:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Start with a global view
\item Narrow to countries expected to outperform
\item Select the best sectors within those countries
\item Optionally, select best companies within sectors
\end{enumerate}
If the investor has a knack for knowing where the next opportunity lies, the most reward typically comes from concentrated exposure rather than diversified index holdings.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Major Equity Indices by Region}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item United States: S\&P 500, Nasdaq, DJIA, Russell 2000, Wilshire 5000
\item Europe: Euro Stoxx 50, DAX, CAC 40, FTSE 100, FTSE MIB, IBEX 35, AEX
\item Asia Ex-Japan: Shanghai Comp, Hang Seng, KOSPI, ASX 200, NZX 50
\item Japan: Nikkei, Topix, JASDAQ
\item Emerging Markets: Bovespa, NIFTY, Micex/RTS, Mexico IPC, TOP 40/JALSH, BIST 30/100 etc.
\end{enumerate}
Indices can be traded directionally or as relative value trades (long one index, short another). Different indices have different sector exposures: Bovespa is more commodity-sensitive than NIFTY; S\&P 500 has more financial exposure than Nasdaq (technology-weighted).
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Index Construction Methods}\\
Index construction methodology affects interpretation:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Price-Weighted: considers only stock price, ignores market cap. A single large stock move can dominate.
\item Market-Cap Weighted: weighted by market capitalisation. Large-cap stocks dominate performance.
\item Equal-Weighted: each constituent has equal weight regardless of size.
\end{enumerate}
Understanding weighting structure is essential for accurate interpretation of index moves.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Sector Rotation Across Economic Cycles}\\
Different sectors outperform in different economic regimes:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Recession/Contraction: Consumer Staples, Utilities, Healthcare (defensive sectors)
\item Recovery: Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Real Estate
\item Expansion: Industrials, Materials, Technology
\item Slowing Growth/Late Cycle: Energy, Materials (inflation hedges)
\end{enumerate}
To best position an equity portfolio, it is critical to know whether the economy is in contraction, recovery, expansion, or slowing growth.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Equity Derivatives Overview}\\
Key equity derivatives for macro trading:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item ETFs: fast, cheap exposure to indices, sectors, countries, commodities, FX, FI. Trade like stocks.
\item ADRs (American Depositary Receipts): foreign stocks listed on U.S. exchanges in USD. Subject to FX risk since underlying shares are held locally.
\item Index Futures: liquid, leveraged exposure to equity indices.
\item Options: provide asymmetric payoffs for hedging and directional views.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{The Volatility Index (VIX)}\\
The VIX measures implied volatility of S\&P 500 options one month out. Key properties:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Negatively correlated with equity returns (volatility rises when equities fall)
\item During large selloffs, VIX can move from mid-teens to 30+ in days
\item VIX options provide asymmetric hedges for equity portfolios
\item VIX futures typically trade in contango; during sharp selloffs, shift to backwardation
\end{enumerate}
Volatility is measured relative to $\sqrt{252} \approx 16$. A VIX of 16 implies approximately $1\%$ expected daily move; VIX of $24$ implies $1.5\%$ daily move $(24/16 = 1.5\%)$.\\
V2X (Euro Stoxx), VXN (Nasdaq), VXD (DJIA), RVX (Russell 2000), GVZ (Gold), OVX (Crude Oil).
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Variance Swaps}\\
Variance swaps are OTC products providing pure variance exposure. Advantages over options:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Pure volatility exposure without delta hedging
\item Priced with realised volatility (usually lower than implied)
\item No interest rate or dividend risk
\end{enumerate}
Payoff structure is convex and nonlinear. Long variance benefits disproportionately from large moves in either direction. Quoted by strike (reference realised volatility), vega notional, variance units, maturity.\\
Variance units $= \frac{\text{Vega Notional}}{2 \times \text{Strike}}$, Payoff $= (\sigma_{\text{realised}}^2 - K^2) \times \text{Variance Units}$
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Dividend Swaps}\\
An OTC or exchange-traded product that allows one to take a view on dividends of an index to be higher, or lower, than a fixed amount. 
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Equity Valuation Techniques for Macro}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Price-to-Book (P/B): P/B $> 2.5\times$ generally overbought; P/B $< 1.5\times$ oversold. Useful for detecting bubbles and value opportunities.
\item Dividend Yield: dividend/price. Holder gets paid while waiting (long carry). Useful for relative value across markets.
\item Price-to-Earnings (P/E): price per \$1 of earnings. Best for comparable analysis across countries, sectors, stocks. Forward P/E uses analyst EPS estimates.
\item Free Cash Flow Yield: FCF/Price. Cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures. Graham and Dodd value investors use this as top screen.
\item Market Cap to GDP: useful for locating potential bubbles. Above 100\% warrants caution; rapid rises to 150\%+ indicate bubble conditions (Japan 1989).
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{Leading Indicators for Equities}\\
Useful macro indicators that lead equity performance:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): leading indicator scored 0-100. Sharp slope changes and deviations from 50 provide strong signals. ISM below 50 typically indicates U.S. recession.
\item Baltic Dry Index: shipping prices for raw material dry bulk. Supply is fixed (ships take years to build), demand is inelastic. Leading indicator for raw material demand.
\item CDX High Yield Index: CDS spread on high-yield corporates. Highly correlated with VIX; inversely related to equity prices. Rising spreads signal risk-off.
\item Consumer Confidence: in the U.S., consumption accounts for $>70\%$ of GDP. Higher confidence leads to higher spending and GDP growth.
\item Commodity Prices (YoY): rising commodity prices are inflationary, typically met by central bank tightening, which has bearish equity implications.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \hlt{AUD Volatility as Risk Barometer}\\
The Australian dollar is a main risk-on currency due to Australia's commodity exports and reliance on Asian economies. AUD moves in tandem with equity prices.\\
Three-month AUD/USD implied volatility is highly correlated with VIX and inversely correlated with S\&P 500. In times of stress, the rate of change in AUD volatility shifts suddenly and aggressively.\\
Using VIX and AUD volatility combined on an absolute basis smooths out error as a more useful measure.
\end{remark}
