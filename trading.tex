Stochastic Processes and Bayesian Inference:
Topics: Stochastic calculus, Markov processes, Bayesian linear regression, MCMC methods.
Purpose: Equip readers with rigorous tools to model market randomness and update beliefs with new data.
Optimization Techniques:
Topics: Convex optimization, dynamic programming, optimal control theory.
Purpose: Provide the mathematical underpinnings for optimal execution and risk management.
	
	% Quantitative Finance Theory
	(Incorporating insights from market microstructure texts and execution research)

Market Microstructure and Optimal Execution:
Topics: Order flow, transaction cost analysis, smart order routing, and alpha profiling.
Example: Discuss methods like VWAP, TWAP, and implementations from scholarly articles and Wikipedia’s smart order routing overview 
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
.
Derivative Pricing and Risk Management:
Topics: Option pricing models, risk-adjusted cost functions, and sensitivity analysis.
Purpose: Bridge the gap between theoretical pricing models and their algorithmic application.
